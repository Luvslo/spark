Created this game for educational purpose.

This is a text based multidimensional dungeon game where you can visit different rooms. 

You can chat with other users in the same room. Can whisper to a player, or broadcast to the entire world.

The world is designed as a cube, similar to one in Transformers, hence the name "spark".
